## Dropdown Select ( Multi Selction & Single Selection)

Angular Material Library gives us a very interesting feature in <mat-select> and allow us to make multiple selection by adding the property multiple.By default <mat-select> configured to single-selection mode. It works only on the initialization of components. We can not change its property after the initialization of the component.
